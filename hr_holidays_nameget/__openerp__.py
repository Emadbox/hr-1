Hr Holidays Name Get

This module adds the date of leaves defined by employees to nameget.

For example:
Before this module, when an employee called his leaves "holidays 2019" during from 07/01/2019 13:55:00 to 07/15/2019 13:55:00, the name was "holidays 2019".
Now, thanks to this module, the name of the leaves is "holidays 2019 (07/01/2019 13:55:00 -> 07/15/2019 13:55:00)
